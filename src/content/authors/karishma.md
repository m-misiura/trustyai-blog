Hi, I'm Karishma, a Software Quality Engineer currently contributing to the TrustyAI project. With a strong passion for software technology and quality, I focus on ensuring that intelligent systems are not just innovative, but also reliable and fair.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering and a Master's in Communication System Engineering.

Outside of work, I enjoy expressing creativity through cooking and find joy in exploring new places through travel.
