Hi! I'm Amber Blue, a Software Engineer at Red Hat working on TrustyAI. I'm passionate about applying technology in ways that help people trust and understand the tools they use.

I earned my bachelor's in Computer Science and Audio Engineering from Belmont University and my master's in Music Technology from Georgia Tech. In my free time I enjoy playing music, riding my bike, and spending time outdoors.
