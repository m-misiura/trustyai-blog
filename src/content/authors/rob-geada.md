Hi! I'm Rob Geada (jee-ah-da), the tech lead for TrustyAI and a Principal Engineer at Red Hat. I got
my start in ML in 2016 experimenting with Word2Vec, and I've been fascinated by all forms
of machine learning ever since. I'm especially interested in model evaluation- specifically, creating novel evaluation datasets-
as a means of exploring the limits of model capabilities. 

Academically, I hold a PhD from Newcastle University in the design of Convolutional Neural Networks, and an 
undergraduate degree in Physics from the University of Chicago. Personally, I love writing music,
sim-racing, baking, and CAD modeling.
