Hi! I'm an Associate Software Engineer at Red Hat, working on TrustyAI with a focus on making large langauge models more truthsworthy and reliable.

Previously, I worked on creating end-to-end machine learning solutions on the RHOAI team and visualizing various open-source communities on the Emerging Tech (ET) team as an intern.

I earned my bachelor's in math from Boston University where I also conducted research on privacy in ML applications and feature transformations. Here are some things we can nerd out about: statistical machine learning, rock climbing, and finding the ideal oil/flour ratio for banana bread.
