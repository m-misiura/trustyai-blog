I'm Shelton, a Software Quality Engineer contributing towards the Trustyworthy Aspects of AI @ Red Hat. I'm currently based in Galway, Ireland and I hold a Masters degree in A.I. from the University of Galway.

I'm a DIY-er, contribute to various open-source projects and love playing around with ESP32s and Raspberry Pis, networking gear. I also self-host a lot of my services that I use and I also love to cook (literally and figuratively).
