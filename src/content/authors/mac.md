I am Mac Misiura, a PhD-educated software engineer at Red Hat, where I contribute to the TrustyAI project. My work focuses on ensuring the safe and reliable use of Generative AI, with a current emphasis on its safeguarding and evaluation.

Prior to joining Red Hat, I served as a data science consultant at the UK's National Innovation Centre for Data, where I collaborated with a wide range of industry partners, from start-ups to FTSE 100 companies. My role involved developing proof-of-concept solutions that leveraged both Generative AI and traditional machine learning techniques to solve business problems.

In my spare time, I obsess over coffee and breadmaking, which makes me an excellent colleague to have around for the morning coffee run.
