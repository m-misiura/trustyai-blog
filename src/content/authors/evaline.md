Hi! Iâ€™m a software engineer at IBM Research, currently focused on architecting and building guardrails infrastructure for generative AI workflows. My previous experience includes MLOps for cloud machine learning products and adapting responsible and trustworthy AI research for products. My electrical/computer engineering degrees are from Carnegie Mellon University. Outside of work, I can be found hiking or cycling (or looking for the next island to cycle around).
